# Image Steganography
PURPOSE
-The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties.
The main objective of our project is to provide security based on          steganography techniques to hide message carried by stego - media (image) which should not be sensible to human beings and avoid drawing suspicion to the existence of hidden message. 

The main feature of IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY is to encode and decode the hidden messages.
This presentation focuses on the numerous steps to successfully embed and retrieve the data within an image.
To ensure that our GUI-based application is user friendly.

Image Steganography is categorised into two modules:
- Encode
- Decode

- Encode: -
Can choose an image of format .png, .jpg, . jpeg or all files as well but can encode the message and save it only in .png format.
Can enter a secret message in order to encode it into the selected image.
Â 
- Decode: -
Here users can select the image to extract the hidden message.
Image should be of the .png format.

**Conclusion**
From the proposed project we have learned that while implementing Image Steganography is important, and the methods to do so are far more complex than actually doing the Steganography itself.
There is a lot of research that is beginning to discover new ways to detect Steganography, most of which involves some variation of statistical analysis. It is interesting to see what other methods will be developed and how accurate they will be at detecting Steganography. 
Although it is a simple designed but effective one.

**Future Scope**
The overall project can be upgraded by adding support to decode all file formats.
Secondly, we can add a backend to store all the decoded messages by implementing it in html, css, MongoDb.
